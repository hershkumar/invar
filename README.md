# Invar

Idea:
Something like Terry Davis's SimStructure.

## Goals
- Focused on particles, with bonds between them
- Bonds can be either elastic or solid
- Customizable gravity, air resistance, etc.
- Thrusters
- Adjustable time speed

## TODO:
- Set up basic particle rendering, figure out how to store bonds/how to deal with elastic bonds vs regular bonds.
- Figure out how to deal with user input (adding particles, bonds, etc.)
